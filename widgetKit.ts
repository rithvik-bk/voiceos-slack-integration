/**
 * The VoiceOS Widget Kit — the design system every generated integration
 * builds its cards from.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists
 *
 * A widget is a complete HTML document rendered in a locked sandbox, so before
 * this kit every generated integration hand-rolled its own CSS: its own type
 * scale, its own spacing, its own idea of a list row. Two things followed, both
 * bad. The cards never matched each other or the notch around them, because
 * nothing shared a definition of "a row". And the markup competed for output
 * tokens with the code — a model asked to write a working MCP server AND five
 * kilobytes of CSS spends its budget on the CSS and ships a worse server.
 *
 * So the CSS moved here, once, and the integration writes `vList(items)`.
 * A card costs a few hundred tokens instead of several thousand, every
 * integration inherits the same design language, and restyling all of them at
 * once is an edit to this file.
 *
 * Two entry points share that plumbing:
 *  - {@link renderWidget} — compose prebuilt components. The quick path for a
 *    simple card.
 *  - {@link renderCustom} — hand-authored markup + CSS with full pixel
 *    control, for cards that should look like the real product. The kit still
 *    carries the bridge, the mark, the escaping, and the byte cap.
 *
 * This module is COPIED INTO EVERY GENERATED INTEGRATION FOLDER as
 * `widgetKit.ts`, next to `server.ts`. That is why it has zero imports and
 * zero dependencies: it has to run under whatever bun or tsx the user's
 * machine provides, with nothing installed.
 *
 * ## The constraints it is shaped by
 *
 * - **No network.** The host page's CSP blocks every fetch, image, and font
 *   request from inside the frame. Everything is inline; images must be
 *   `data:` URIs; the font stack is the system one.
 * - **128KB per card**, and 60-420 CSS px tall, on a ~388px-wide column.
 * - **The bridge is the only channel**: `voiceos:init` in (data, args, theme),
 *   `voiceos:resize` / `voiceos:openUrl` / `voiceos:updateInput` out.
 * - **Theme comes from the bridge, never from `prefers-color-scheme`.** The
 *   notch is unconditionally black, so the OS appearance is the wrong signal —
 *   keying off it renders a light card on a black surface for every user whose
 *   Mac is in light mode. `prefers-reduced-motion` IS honoured, because that
 *   one really is a user preference about behaviour.
 * - **The confirm button is not ours.** On a confirmation card VoiceOS floats
 *   its own button over the bottom-right corner, so `mode: "confirm"` reserves
 *   that space and no card may draw its own approve/cancel control.
 * - **The integration's logo is the header's first element.** See
 *   {@link INTEGRATION_MARK} — the card identifies itself the way an app does,
 *   and no integration has to remember to do it.
 * - **The corner is not the card's to choose.** Every VoiceOS card is cut at
 *   the same radius, and the surface does the cutting — so a card that paints
 *   its own background or border writes `border-radius: var(--k-radius)` and
 *   never a number. See {@link WIDGET_KIT_LIMITS}.`surfaceRadius`.
 * - **The surface finish is the kit's, on by default.** Every card gets the
 *   liquid-glass rim (`.k-rim` — a 1px inset hairline with a brighter top
 *   edge, on the same `--k-radius` arc as the host's clip). A card with a
 *   declared accent additionally gets a soft wash of the accent out of the
 *   top-left corner. The mark stays a bare glyph in both cases — never on an
 *   accent tile, a chip, or any invented backdrop; the icon's own artwork is
 *   the identity. Cards draw none of this themselves — a second border or a
 *   hand-made logo tile doubles the chrome.

 * Fetch a remote image and return it as a `data:` URI, or null.

 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The card sandbox has no network, so `<img src="https://…">` inside a card is
 * always an empty box. But the TOOL HANDLER is ordinary Node with ordinary
 * network access — it can fetch the artwork and hand the card the bytes. That
 * asymmetry was never written down anywhere, so generated cards read the rule
 * as "images are impossible" and shipped without the single most recognisable
 * element most products have: the album art, the avatar, the thumbnail, the
 * favicon of the site being linked.
 *
 * Two things to know before calling it:
 *
 *  - **Ask the API for a SMALL image.** The budget is bytes AFTER base64, so
 *    the original file has to be about three quarters of `maxBytes`. Nearly
 *    every API exposes a size: Spotify returns several entries in `images[]`,
 *    Gravatar and GitHub take `?s=64`, most CDNs take a width parameter. Pick
 *    the smallest that still looks right at its RENDERED size — a 32px row
 *    thumbnail on a 2× display wants 64px, not 640px.
 *  - **It never throws.** A timeout, a 404, an HTML error page, a wrong
 *    content-type, or an oversized file all return null, and the card is
 *    expected to draw its placeholder instead. An integration that fails
 *    because a thumbnail didn't load is worse than one with no thumbnail.

 * bespoke card cannot be trusted to carry itself:
 *  - the bridge (theme, height report, arg hydration via `data-voiceos-key`,
 *    link routing for plain https anchors),
 *  - the integration's mark — embedded wherever the body placed
 *    {@link markHtml}, or floated over the top-left when it didn't, so a
 *    custom card can never go out unsigned,
 *  - the colour variables and per-theme accent repair,
 *  - the 128KB document cap (content images are dropped first; a card still
 *    over the cap throws, because the host would drop it silently).
